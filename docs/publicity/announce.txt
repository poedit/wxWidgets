April 24, 2025 -- The wxWidgets team is pleased to announce a new
stable release of our open source framework for the development of native
cross-platform applications in C++.

wxWidgets 3.2.8 is part of the API and ABI-stable 3.2.x release series and is
now available from

    https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/

and

    https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/v3.2.8


This is mostly a bug fix release correcting several problems found in the
previous 3.2.7 release:

- Fix crash in wxPropertyGrid with wxGTK3 after recent change (#25286).
- Fix padding of wxMenu in high DPI under Windows 11 (#25117).
- Fix key codes in WXK_NUMPADx events in wxGTK (#25263).
- Fix ABI breakage for versioned symbols in 3.2.7 (#25327).
- Fix third party libraries build with Xcode 16.3.
- Fix using OpenGL and WebView when using CMake install (#25266).

But it still contains a couple of enhancements, including:

- Add wxVector(std::initializer_list<U> list) ctor (#25290).
- Add mouse scrolling support to generic wxSpinCtrl (#24935).
- Add @USER@ macro to HTML and RichText printers (#25318).

Other changes include:

- Call OnExceptionInMainLoop() in wxGTK if idle event handler throws (#25312).
- Compute wxStaticText best size ourselves if GTK does it wrongly (#24781).
- Fix page count display in wxHtmlPrintout when there is only one page (#25320).
- Miscellaneous CMake build improvements (#25324).
- Fix new warnings with gcc 15 (#25338).
- Update Brazilian Portuguese translations.

Please see the full change log for more details:

This release is API and ABI-compatible with the previous 3.2.x, meaning that
the existing applications don't even need to be rebuilt to profit from all the
fixes above if they use shared/dynamic libraries. And if they do need to be
recompiled, this can be done without any changes to the code.

We hope that you will enjoy using the new release!

Vadim Zeitlin, on behalf of wxWidgets development team.
